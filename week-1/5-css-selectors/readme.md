# CSS Selectors

There are no background colours applied to the messages in this example. Look closely at the HTML code for this example. Then open the `message-backgrounds.css` file and use CSS selectors for id, tag and class names to give each message a different background. _Do not edit the `index.html` file._

1. Give the first message a `red` background color.
2. Give the second message a `cadetblue` background color.
3. Give the third message a `yellow` background color.
4. When you are finished, use git to add, commit and push your changes.

_Hint: Each message has a unique id, tag or class name that you can use to only target that message._
